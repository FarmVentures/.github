# Farmers Ventures

> Revolutionizing African Agriculture Through Blockchain

## 🙌 Overview

Farmers Ventures seeks to use blockchain technology to improve agricultural practices in Africa, where a large population relies on agriculture for sustenance and as a means of earning a living. The platform connects farmers, agricultural societies, governments, and buyers, providing crucial information on crops through a decentralized application.

The system addresses critical challenges in African agriculture, including inefficient food production, genetic quality degradation, environmental challenges, and limited technology access. Through blockchain technology, Farmers Ventures creates a transparent, secure ecosystem that incentivizes sustainable farming practices.

The platform relies on FC tokens to incentivize farmers to provide information on crop planting and harvesting. Farmers earn FC by providing data to the platform while buyers, agricultural societies, and governments access the information by paying with FC. Over time, this creates a rich database to improve farming techniques across the continent.
